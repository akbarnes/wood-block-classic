# WoodBlock Classic

This is an InkScape SVG file for lasercutting a wooden dummy of a popular portable music player using the Ponoko lasercutting service. Once cut, the wooden dummy can be assembled with yellow wood glue. It is "useful" for those of us who still use powered speakers and alarm clocks with a 40-pin docking connector. The wooden dummy makes that empty docking port seem not-so-empty. RIP Steve.
